# electron-app

**About this app**

This is personal project to explore and experiment with electron. This app is under constuction. 

The original structure is based on [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.
