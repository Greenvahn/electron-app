# electron-app

**About this app**
This is personal project to explore and experiment with electron. The app is based on [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation. This project is in progress... All suggestions are welcome.

**Use this app along with the [Electron API Demos](https://electronjs.org/#get-started) app for API code examples to help you get started.**

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.
